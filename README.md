## 5. DISCLAIMER

I am NOT a computer expert. I AM exploring & learning more about my computer and it's capabilities and features. The following steps are those I obtained or derived from reading and/or watching the references indicated in the README.md file of this repository. I have tried to capture the steps that I took in customizing my own terminal shell prompt. I present these steps as an effort to share what I've learned with others and provide a concise walk through to help save time and for future use. 

If YOU choose to follow these steps to customize your terminal shell prompt and/or alter your `.bash_profile` or any other files on your computer, you do so at your own risk. I do not accept any responsibility for changes you make or actions you take involving your own computer.
